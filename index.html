  	<h1>About</h1>
		<p>This project was conducted as a dissertation, the aim being to experiment with clustering and topological data analysis to detect hidden gene expression in three single-cell RNA-seq datasets.

		<h1>Background</h1>
		<h2>Genes and Proteins</h2>
		<p><img src="Assets/Images/scRNA-seq-Steps.png" alt="Single-cell RNA sequencing steps" id="scRNA-seq-steps"></img></p>
		<p>In biology, genes are small sections of DNA that encode proteins.
			These are important biomolecules with a large range of functions such as: enzymes, antibodies, structural proteins, storage or cell signalling.
			Therefore studying gene expression can reveal useful knowledge about the biological processes of cells.</p>
		<p>
			Proteins are produced in cells through two steps: transcription and translation.
			Transcription is when sections of DNA are copied to produce a complementary molecule called messenger RNA (mRNA).
			The mRNA then travels to a ribosome and where a protein is constructed in a process known as translation.
			This means that cellular gene expression can be inferred through reading the sequence of bases RNA.</p>
		<h2>Single-Cell RNA-Sequencing</h2>
		<p>
			Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is a method in which genetic expression is measured across a population of heterogeneous cells, i.e. cells of the same type.
			Improvements in sequencing technologies have made it easy for scientists to read gene expression for thousands if not millions of cells within an experiment.
			This provides an abundance of big data suitable for evaluation by computational methods.
